Introduction to Data structures, Hashing:
Types of Data Structure - Linear & Nonlinear, Static & Dynamic, Characteristics of algorithms,
Analysis of algorithms – Frequency Count, Time & Space complexity Hashing: Concepts - Hash table,
issues in hashing, hash functions- properties of good hash function, division, multiplication, extraction,
mid-square, folding and universal, Collision resolution strategies- open addressing and chaining.

Linked List:
Dynamic Memory Management, Basics of Linked List, Comparison of sequential and linked
organizations, Types of linked list, Singly linked list, Doubly linked list, Circular linked list.
Applications: Polynomial Operations.
Case study: Use of generalized linked list.

Stack & Queue:
Fundamentals of stack, Stack representation using array and linked List, Operations on stack.Applications: Recursion, Validity of parentheses, Expression Conversion. Fundamentals of queue,
Queue representation using array and Linked List, Types of queue – Linear Queue, Circular Queue,
Double Ended Queue, Priority Queue. Applications: Job Scheduling, Josephus problem.
Case study: Evaluation of postfix expression using stack.

Tree:
Basic terminology, representation using array and linked list, Recursive and Non recursive Tree
Traversals, Operations on binary tree: Finding Height, Leaf nodes, counting no of Nodes, Construction
of binary tree from traversals, Binary Search tree (BST): Insertion, deletion of a node from BST.
Threaded Binary tree (TBT): Creation and traversals on TBT. Height Balanced Tree- AVL tree.
Case study: Max Heap, Min Heap using binary tree.

Graph:
Basic Concepts, Storage representation, Adjacency matrix, adjacency list, adjacency multi list, inverse
adjacency list. Traversals-depth first and breadth first search,
Applications Minimum spanning Tree using Prim‟s and Kruskal‟s Algorithm.
Case study: Shortest path calculation using graph.

Sorting Techniques & Multi way Trees:
Sorting methods- Quick sort and Merge Sort, Radix Sort, Heap sort, Shell sort. Multi
way Trees: B tree, B+ tree.
